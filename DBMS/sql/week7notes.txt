functional depedency,
constraint on the possible rows in a table
value neutral like PK and FK
Asserted
Understand business rules

X determines Y or X -> Y
for each x value, there is at most one Y value
StdNo -> StdCity if each student values has at most oneStdCity values
x lhs
y rhs

Unique Constraint analogy
similar to uniqueness constraint
places rhs and lhs table by themseleves

Falsification of fds using sample rows
-> prove non existannce by  looking at data


Normalization: process of removing unwanted redundancies from design

The input to normalizations list of functional dependncies in a table deisgn includeing designation of unique columns
Appling normal form involves detecting violations of the allowable pattern of fd and splitting original table into smaller table if a voilation is found

BCNF Procedure
-> group  fds -> same determinant
-> define tables -> each fd group, determinent as pk, fks
-> merge tables -> containment, prevents excessive splitting

refinement normalization better than intial normalization 

Denormalization : purposeful violation of a normal form(easy to query, difficult to modify)
