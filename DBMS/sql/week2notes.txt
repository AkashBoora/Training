Relational Data Model

Why is the relational data model commercially dominant?

Relational db devloped because familiriaty and similarity

relational database is a collection of tables
headings: table name and column names
Body: rows and occurance of data
matching values we connect db

Table Oriented			Set Oriented			Recoed Oriented
Table						Relational				Record Type,File
Row							Tuple					Record
Column						Attribute				Field


Integrity Rules:
Null values: Absense of a value(missing value), Actual value unknown or not applicable for a row.
Primary Key: Column or combination of columns with unique values in each row, no exttraneous columns
Foreign Key: Column or combination of columns related to a primary key in another table which is related. Same data type and often same name as releated PK

Entity Integrity
primary key for each table
a primary key can not have null values
Entities integirity ensures entities people things places

Referential Integrity
column valus in one tablemust match column values in another table which is related
some foreign keys can allow null value, most foreign keys do not allow null values
two kinds of values for a foreign key in a row
ensures valid refernces among table

In er diagram
p -> primary key
f -> foriegn key
pf -> part of primary key and foreign key
lines represent relations
appering next to the arrow is parent
appearing next to the foot symbol is child
solid line repreasents foriegn key can not have missing values
dashed line, foreign key canhave missing values


datatypes
char (L)characters(l) fixed length
varchar (L) characters varying length
integer for numbers
float(p) no of positions
decimal(w,r)  w-> total noof digits  r-> number of digits to the right of the decimal point
date, time, timestamp
